        <span class="date">10th October, 2014</span>
    </header>

    <p>If you are doing a small task frequently then spending a little time to speed up that task really can pay off in a significant way (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">relevant xkcd</a>). As a developer there are few tools you will be interacting with more times a day than git, so lets speed it up!</p>
<h2 id="alias-git">Alias git</h2>
<p>First things first, you are going to want to alias <code>git</code> to something even shorter. Open up your <code>.bash_profile</code> (or <code>.zshrc</code> if you are using that) in nano or whatever and append:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">g</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"git"</span>
</code></pre><p>Now you will be able to reference commands like <code>git checkout master</code> using just <code>g checkout master</code>.</p>
<h2 id="alias-git-s-commands">Alias git&#39;s commands</h2>
<p>That&#39;s a good start but <code>checkout</code> is a lot of characters, let&#39;s bring that down along with all the other git commands. Git comes with it&#39;s own aliasing which you can configure by running this in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.a add
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.b branch
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.c commit
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.cf config
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.co checkout
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.s status
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.sh stash
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.pl pull
g config --<span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span>.ps push
</code></pre><p>Now your typical workflow can be reduced to:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>g co -b <span class="hljs-string">"feature/foo"</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>g a .
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>g c -m <span class="hljs-string">"Added foo"</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>g ps
</code></pre><p>This is pretty great, it may seem like only a few characters but if you are typing those characters dozens of times a day it can add up quickly.</p>
<h2 id="alias-your-workflow">Alias your workflow</h2>
<p>And we can take it one final step further. What is your most common action? Pulling down the latest changes, adding and commiting yours on top and then pushing back up. So lets shorten that as far as we possibly can. Once again, open up and edit your <code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>.zshrc</code> file and append it with a custom method:</p>
<pre><code>gqc() {
    g sh &amp;&amp; g pl &amp;&amp; g sh <span class="hljs-keyword">pop</span> &amp;&amp; g a . &amp;&amp; g c -<span class="hljs-keyword">m</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$1</span> &amp;&amp; g ps
}
</code></pre><p>Here we stash any local changes, pull the remote, pop our local changes, add them, then commit with the first argument as the message and finally push them up. You can call it like so:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>gqc <span class="hljs-string">"Updated foo"</span>
</code></pre><p>What would have required 80 keystrokes can now be done in 18. At 60 wpm that&#39;s a saving of about 13 seconds each time (not counting waiting) which could be 5 to 10 minutes a day. That&#39;s around 30 hours a year. Or 50 days in a 40 year career! 50 days saved, from what is a 5 minute job!</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p><em>totally accurate numbers...</em></p>

        <span class="date">5th June, 2014</span>
    </header>

    <h2 id="free-is-a-lie">Free is a lie</h2>
<p>Something you absolutely should do is watch <a href="http://twitter.com/aral">Aral Balkan&#39;s</a> talk <a href="https://indietech.org/video/">&quot;Free is a lie&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>The driving point of the talk is that while a service may be monetarily free to use, you still have to pay. You pay with your data. How much of an issue that is can be debated. Personally I&#39;m in this probably common position of disliking the idea that Google etc are selling my data, but at the same time since it doesn&#39;t seem to affect me and they provide good services I happy to keep using them. And that is the exact reason why the concept of Indie Tech needs to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-existing-free-open-source-services">The problem with existing free / open source services</h2>
<p><a href="http://duckduckgo.com">There</a> <a href="http://status.net/">are</a> <a href="http://owncloud.org/">services</a> that exist that do not sell your data or can be self-hosted. But the problem is, these are not integrated into your phone or operating system. If I told any non-tech friend, or indeed many tech friends, to setup their own self-hosted cloud I would just get blank stares. Why go through that hassle? Why buy a Raspberry Pi or find a hosting provider? When you can just go to <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> or <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, click register, enter your name and email address and you&#39;re done.</p>
<p>Compounding this issue, many open-source projects are never going to make money. They are going to be built by devs in their spare time for fun, and after <a href="http://heartbleed.com">Heartbleed</a> we know how that turns out.</p>
<p>On the whole most of these services are made by programmers, not designers. It&#39;s just the way it is with open source projects. This leads to often ugly tools and terrible UX which turns away users who have gotten this far.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-an-indie-ecosystem-or-three-">We need an indie ecosystem (or three)</h2>
<p>So the better solution to this is an entirely indie ecosystem. That means hardware, software, services and design. It needs to be designed from scratch to be consistent with itself, not a mix of differing tools with different languages of interaction. It needs to be built from scratch to protect your data and privacy to the extent that you desire. It needs to be open about how it handles your data though not necessarily open source.</p>
<p>A fantastic push in this direction is coming from <a href="http://indiephone.eu">Indie Phone</a>. It&#39;s not just an operating system, it&#39;s the full hardware and ecosystem as well. Though by itself this is not enough, ideally there needs to be choice for the consumer, rival products that compete for different sectors of the market.</p>
<h2 id="cutting-out-the-middle-man">Cutting out the middle man</h2>
<p>Beyond this we need more services that do not rely on capturing and analysing user data. An idea that I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while and have done experimenting with is a peer-to-peer social network.</p>
<p>It would allow you to store your data wherever you like, locally on your computer or phone, on some free or private cloud service. It would allow you to share the exact data you want to share with exactly who you want to share it with. It would send that data directly to the other users via a peer-to-peer connection. Indeed, if it was abstracted enough it could be that the service itself becomes just an interface to sending and receiving data.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really know if this is a viable concept, or indeed if there is any business there, but it&#39;s something I&#39;d like to see discussed.</p>
<h2 id="indie-tech-summit">Indie Tech Summit</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re also interested in the idea of independent tech and an independent internet then you should join me in going to the <a href="https://indietech.org/summit/">Indie Tech Summit</a> on July 4th &amp; 5th in Brighton. It&#39;s not just a conference where you&#39;re talked at, it&#39;s a discussion with a great list of speakers. Bring you&#39;re ideas, arguments and concepts and get involved in ensuring we have a better independent internet for the future.</p>

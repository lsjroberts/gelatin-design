    <p><strong>Neon Spores</strong> is a game about helping your green plants evolve and spread faster than the evil
        purple plants.</p>

    <p>You can shoot your green spores to give them energy to grow faster, and shoot the purple guys to kill them and stop
        their spread. (<a href="https://raw.github.com/gelatindesign/Ludum-Dare-24-Evolution/master/how-to-play.png">How

    <p><strong>I Painted a Tiny World</strong> is a game about collecting tiny worlds with your vacuum and painting your
        own platforms to run on.</p>

    <p>The paint gradually slides away and disappears forcing your to keep moving.</p>

    <p>Your enemies are 'turpentine' blobs that fly past wiping away your paint.</p>

    <p>You can see a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxaIvwKyML0">video of the game here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Project ISO</h3>

    <p>
        My main project for this year is a game that aims to break a few
        expectations a player may have towards games - winning is not always
        possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a dynamic story-driven game with isometric turn-based strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
        It doesn't currently have a name, so I'm going with <em>Project ISO</em>
        because that's short for isometric...

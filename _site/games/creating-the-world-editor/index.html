        <p>I’m splitting development into sprints with set objectives. The primary target is to develop the game to a playable state at the end of each sprint. This is to ensure motivation is maintained and the progress can be tested and feedback can be received on the current state.</p>

<p>For this, the second sprint, I focused on refactoring my original ideas and developing the initial world editor with river and elevation brushes.</p>

<h2 id="refactor">Refactor</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago <a href="https://twitter.com/czaplic">Evan</a> (the author of Elm) wrote a tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial">architecture in Elm</a>. This is a fantastic resource that you should definitely read if you are already or are interested in using Elm.</p>

<p>I used this as a guide to refactoring my initial ideas and experiments on rendering an isometric map.</p>

<h2 id="render">Render</h2>

<p>Before I could start on editing a map I needed to render it out to the screen. Admittedly a simpler route would have been to just use text files or one of the existing isometric tile layout tools. However I fully intend to release the world editor as part of the game, and honestly it felt like a good place to start with learning a few techniques in elm.</p>

<p>So now in <code>World</code> I have defined a default world as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">default : Model
default =
    { tileList = World.TileList.update
        (World.TileList.Fill World.Tile.GrassTile (10,10))
        World.TileList.default
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This fires off an update action to the <code>TileList</code> model (which defaults to a single grass tile). The update fills a 10 by 10 grid with grass tiles.</p>

    <h3>ISO</h3>

    <p>
        A dynamic story-driven game with isometic turn-based strategy that aims
        to break a few expectations a player may have towards games - winning is
        not always possible or clear cut.

    <p>
        It doesn't currently have a name, so I'm going with <em>ISO</em>
        because that's short for isometric...

Determinism. When I start to consider how far we can simplify everything, how small a piece we can break it all in to, I can arrive at only one conclusion. Where we have been, where we are and where we will be are all entirely known. Through one single equation of enormous complexity, built upon a near infinite yet countable number of simple functions, the universe describes the full extent of space and time.

An almost indecipherable complexity built upon a knowable simplicity.

Yet despite this, on the face of it, depressing view of reality I find it's deep core to be one of optimism, wonder and joy.

When we look at the complexity of ourselves how do we break it down into simpler parts?

Let's start with what it feels like to be a human. Body. Soul. Spirit? I have presense and I can make sense of my experiences and the environment around me. I can interact with my environment and observe it's responses. But these descriptions all fall down by neglecting to reduce their complexity into what they really mean. Take for example the classic "_I think therefore I am._" What does it mean to think? What does "_I am_" even mean?

So we could instead consider the organs that make the organism. What makes me myself must be inside me; that seems like a simple enough concept. The brutal techniques of the 19th century theatre played out to a captive audience are mostly gone in favour of minimally invasive precision. We can [...]

## Chapter One --- Chance

1,150 billion. That is the number of generations that have existed prior to you in your family tree.

3.8 billion. That is the number of years since the last universal ancestor that exists in the family tree of all life today.

13.8 billion.

Where we are is perhaps even more remarkable than where we have been.

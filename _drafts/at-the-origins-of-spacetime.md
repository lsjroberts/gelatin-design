### A Starting Point

1) When there can no longer be an answer to a question on a idea, that idea exists in one of three states: incomplete, falsified or true.

2) All ideas can be categorised into one of these states.

3) There can exist only one idea that is definitively true; that idea can not be proven to be true until all knowables are known.

A fourth state begs to exist but can be reduced to a denied falsehood. When a question is asked of an idea and the only response is a lack of space for an answer then that idea is false. This can be contrasted with an incomplete idea that is answerable within a future space.

When I consider how far we can simplify everything, how small a piece we can break it all in to, I can arrive at only one conclusion. Where we have been, where we are and where we will be are all entirely knowable. Through one single equation of enormous complexity, built upon a near infinite yet countable number of simple functions, the universe describes the full extent of space and time.

An apparently indecipherable complexity built upon knowable simplicities.

Yet despite this on the face of it depressing view of reality I find it's deep core to be one of optimism and wonder.

I am no student of philosophy, these statements are likely flawed, but they are my thoughts regarding everything.

    <strong>Where we have been</strong>

## Chapter One --- Chance

1,150 billion. That is the number of generations that have existed prior to you in your family tree.

3.8 billion. That is the number of years since the last universal ancestor that exists in the family tree of all life today.

It is often said that the existance of you as you are is so highly unlikely as to be near infinitely impossible. I contend the truth is the exact opposite. The existance of you as you are was always going to happen, it is a guarantee and nothing could ever change that fact.


### Chaos

If you roll a standard die what are the odds that it lands on six? Initially it seems this has an obvious answer but let's step back for a moment. The state of the present you are in determines the future of the die, how you hold it as you throw, the moisture and friction of your hand, the surface it lands on. But these are things of the present that we can only approximate and they do not approximately determine the future. The minutest change can cause an entirely different number to be the rolled. This is chaos theory.

Yet chaos theory exists purely because we do not know all knowables in the given system. And it is not a gradient, it is not a case of the more we know the more accurately we can determine the outcome. Only by completely knowing absolutely everything within the contained system can we go from guessing correctly one in six times to deciding exactly.

Chaos theory is a description of a perceived complexity resulting from holding only an incomplete collection of simpler functions.


### Finity

The most important unanswered question that leaves this idea incomplete: is the universe finite?

If the universe is finite we can state that we exist within an enclosed system, a system with a fixed quantity of data. A finite set of knowables.

If the universe is infinite we would have to have infinite capacity for knowledge. But this does not preclude the universe from having infinite knowledge and thus the idea of a knoweable system is still valid.

    Part Two
    <strong>Where we are</strong>
</h2>

Where we are is perhaps even more remarkable than where we have been.

When we look at the complexity of ourselves how do we break it down into simpler parts?

Before the advent of reason all we could describe was how it felt to be a human. Body. Soul. Spirit? I have presense and I can make sense of my experiences and the environment around me. I can interact with my environment and observe it's responses. These descriptions fall down by neglecting to reduce their complexity into what they really mean. What is the body? Is there a soul and where does it reside? What does it even mean to think?

Outside our body we found many inexplicable phenomenon. ...

So we could instead consider the organs that make the organism. What makes me myself must be inside me; that seems like a simple enough concept. ...

The brutal techniques of the 19th century theatre played out to a captive audience are mostly gone in favour of minimally invasive precision. ...

We've explored every part of the human body but it will be many decades before we understand fully the functionality of the brain. ...

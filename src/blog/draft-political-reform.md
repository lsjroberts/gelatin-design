_Warning, the following is opinion._

## The problems

There are several major issues with the structure of democracy in the UK. These reduce the representation of the population's political view, hinder action and damage trust of the government.


### First past the post

Members of Parliament are elected in a first-past-the-post ballot whereby the candidate with the most votes for the region wins the seat. This sounds pretty logical at first, and indeed was a good system for the country when it was originally designed. Each area sent their local representative to Parliament to voice opinion and issues relating to them.

However it has one glaring flaw, the number of votes cast is irrelevant. Whether the candidate wins by a single vote or a massive margin, they still take the seat. This leads to situations where the majority of the population nationally vote for a party which actually ends up taking 2nd place in number of seats. If they win their seats by a large margin and lose by a small margin the overall opinion of the population is not accurately represented.

Often the impulse response is to suggest a proportional representation system, but this is an even more terrible idea. Primarily because it allows single-policy and extremist parties to get a say in national issues. Democracy is about pushing the majority viewpoint to the forefront and following the majorities priniciples while allowing a platform for minority opinions to be voiced. However minority opinons have no place in the running of a nation, they only impede and polute an effective government.


### Regional seats taken by centrally focused MPs

If your MP is the Prime Minister, a member of the cabinet or has another high responsibility position they are naturally going to have less time to focus on your local needs.

In addition to your local MP there is also the local council, these generally cover a smaller region and are focused on certain minutae of government. But this doesn't solve the problem of your MP spending a large proportion of their time in London. All you end up with is a group of power hungry nitpickers instead of a single strong leader. Grouped leadership on this level is a bad idea and you just end up with ineffective, inefficient and inactive government.


### An unelected house that does not represent the people

The House of Lords was a good idea. It worked well. It is no longer a good idea. It no longer works well. We should no longer give power to individuals because their ancestors won a battle and took some land. We should no longer give power to individuals because they follow the religion the state dictates is the best. We should no longer give power to individuals because they are friends with the people in charge.

Just scrap it and let's move on. Tradition and history are nice but looking backwards hinders progress.


## Some potential solutions

So, we want to create effective local leadership but also have correct representation of the communties views at the centralised national level. These are two roles that require two solutions.


### Regional mayors

The concept of the Mayor of London has been one of the best changes in UK governance since Parliament was created. It is an idea that should be taken and brought to the rest of the nation.

The existing mayors of most towns are purely ceremonial and pointless. Stop wasting money and scrap these. Instead create mayors for larger regions. We could keep it simple and just have one mayor for each county, but instead it seems a better approach would be to create additional mayors for the large conurbations at the centre of some counties. For example, a Mayor of Greater Manchester, Mayor of Brighton & Hove, Mayor of Bournemouth & Poole. This would prevent inner city issues taking precendence over more rural priorites.

The mayor of each region would be elected in a simple most votes wins method. They can then choose an unelected group of local business and community leaders to provide policy support and feedback. Community leaders should be chosen to represent all groups including all religions and beliefs. We need to move past the idea that this is a purely Christian nation and remove the concept of a state religion. There are many belief sets and they should all have equal representation.

The mayor would take on all powers of the current local councils and replace them entirely. They need not have any party alignment and ideally should be independant of party politics. They are there purely to focus on local issues.

Each mayor would be given a budget that they can choose to spend as they wish without inteference from the central government. If they desire they can work with neighbouring mayors and build cross-regional transport links and improvements, sharing budget as they see fit.


### Better representation in the central government

We want the differing regional opinions to be represented fairly in Parliament, however we don't want the representatives to have their focus split between local and national issues. The solution is to have regional votes using a proportional representation system.

I said earlier that proportional representation is a terrible idea as it allows minority opinions to influence national decisions. However this can be overcome by having a cutoff point.

At the moment there are 650 MPs representing 650 constituencies. Instead reduce this to somewhere between 14 and 20 constituencies. Each constituency would vote with a PR system to elect between 30 and 40 MPs. Any party with less than 2 or 3 MPs would not receive any seats for that constituency.

The number of MPs are totalled up and the parties can then choose which MPs they wish to send. These MPs do not have to relate to the regions which voted. Essentially this allows the parties to stick their preferred candidates at the top of their list and work downwards in priority.

What this system results in is each region voting for their opinion fairly but at the same time not allowing minority single-policy parties access to national government. The population's opinion is represented proportionally within Parliament and the elected MPs can focus entirely on their role for the nation.


### Improved voter involvement

This system would enable people to vote for an effective leader without worrying they may indirectly be voting a party they dislike into national power. It would allow voters to maintain their party allegiances while giving them freedom to choose the right man or woman for their local area.

This would very likely improve voter engagment and increase election attendance.


## Other points

### The Monarchy

Honestly I just don't think it matters politically if we have a monarchy or not. At this point it has no real powers, there are a few remaining that can be removed at some point in the future. It's just a great source of money, tourism is big bucks. I don't imagine it will last past a few more generations anyway.


## Interactive charts based on the 2010 election

Obviously if these changes were to come into effect the voting would be significantly different as described. However here you can see how the seats might go if this system was used with the voting counts of the 2010 election.

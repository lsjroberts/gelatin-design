_Warning, the following is opinion._

> Only 18% trust governments to put the nation's needs above those of a political party, down from 38% in 1986.

Democracy is stagnating. Voter turnout in the UK had a marked fall in the 90's, rose slightly last decade but not at all up to the historical norm. Disatisfaction with political parties is growing.

#### Turnout for each election since 1945 ([source](http://ukpolitical.info/turnout45.htm))

<div id="chart-voter-turnout" class="chart"></div>

It will be very interesting to see the turnout for the coming 2015 election. If it does not rise towards pre-2000s levels or falls further it will be a clear demonstration of the need for change.

## The problems

There are several major issues with the structure of democracy in the UK. These reduce the representation of the population's political view, hinder action and damage trust of the government.


### First past the post

Members of Parliament are elected in a [first past the post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) ballot whereby the candidate with the most votes for the region wins the seat. This sounds pretty logical at first, and indeed was a good system for the country when it was originally designed. Each area sent their local representative to Parliament to voice opinion and issues relating to them.

However it has one glaring flaw, the number of votes cast is irrelevant. Whether the candidate wins by a single vote or a massive margin, they still take the seat. This can lead to situations where a large proportion of the population vote for a party which then takes a significantly lower proportion of seats. If they win their seats by a large margin and lose others by a small margin the overall opinion of the population is not accurately represented.

#### UK 2010 election votes percentage vs seats percentage ([source](http://ukpolitical.info/2010.htm))

<div id="chart-uk-2010-election" class="chart"></div>

_Only showing the four parties that have at least one seat in parliament and have candidates across all 4 nations._

As this chart demonstrates, the percentage of seats won doesn't particularly match the percentage of votes won. While it does follow the trend of highest to lowest, it is clear the Lib Dems lost out massively. The Conservatives and Labour gained 30% and 37% on top of their votes, while Lib Dem lost 62% and Greens 80%.



#### Proportional representation?

Often the impulse response is to suggest a [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) system, but on a national level this is not the best idea. Primarily because it allows single-policy and extremist parties to get a say in national issues. This has well known dangers. This is particularly pertinant to the UK for the next election due to the recent rise of the BNP which would devastate us culturally.<!--Democracy is about pushing the majority viewpoint to the forefront and following the majorities priniciples while allowing a platform for minority opinions to be voiced. However minority opinons have no place in the running of a nation, they only impede and polute an effective government.-->

##### UK 2010 election seats under PR ([source](http://ukpolitical.info/2010.htm))

<div id="chart-uk-2010-seats-pr" class="chart"></div>

#### Single transferable vote?

A third option is the [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) method. But as with first past the post this tends towards benefiting larger parties over smaller ones (though in different ways).


### Regional seats taken by centrally focused MPs

If your MP is the Prime Minister, a member of the cabinet or has another high responsibility position they are naturally going to have less time to focus on your local needs.

In addition to your local MP there is also the local council, these are focused on certain minutae of government. But these do not solve the problem of your MP spending a large proportion of their time in London. You lose your strong leader.


### An unelected house that does not represent the people

The House of Lords was a good idea. It worked well. It is no longer a good idea. It no longer works well. We should no longer give power to individuals because their ancestors won a battle and took some land. We should no longer give power to individuals because they follow the religion the state dictates is the best. We should no longer give power to individuals because they are friends with the people in charge.

Just scrap it and let's move on. Tradition and history are nice but looking backwards hinders progress.


## Some potential solutions

So, we want to create effective local leadership but also have correct representation of the communties views at the centralised national level. These are two roles that require two solutions.


### Regional mayors

The concept of the Mayor of London has been a strong change in UK governance. Whether or not you agree with Ken Livingston or Boris Johnson's policies, they have been effective in their role. Implementing several key initiatives such as the extension of the Oyster card, cycle hire and improved cycle safety. It is an idea that should be taken and brought to the rest of the nation.

The existing mayors of most councils are purely ceremonial and pointless. Stop wasting money and scrap these. Instead create mayors for larger regions. We could keep it simple and just have one mayor for each county council (27 currently), but instead it seems a better approach would be to create additional mayors for the large metropolitan councils. For example, a Mayor of Bournemouth & Poole as well as a Mayor of Dorset. This would prevent inner city issues taking precendence over more rural priorites.

The mayor of each region would be elected in a simple most votes wins method. They could then seek out local business and community leaders to provide policy support and feedback. Community leaders should be chosen to represent all groups including all religions and beliefs. We need to move past the idea that this is a Christian nation and remove the concept of a state religion. There are many belief sets and they should all have equal representation.

The mayor would take on all powers of the current local councils and replace them entirely. They need not have any party alignment and ideally should be independant of party politics. They are there purely to focus on local issues.

Each mayor would be given a budget that they can choose to spend as they wish without inteference from the central government. If they desire they can work with neighbouring mayors and build cross-regional transport links and improvements, sharing budget as they see fit.

Budgets shouldn't be reduced where regions are able to save money, as this only encourages wasteful spending to maintain the higher budget. Instead it should be tied to population, regional poverty levels and wealth gap, and to rebalance regions nationally.


### Better representation in the central government

We want the differing regional opinions to be represented fairly in Parliament, however we don't want the representatives to have their focus split between local and national issues. The solution is to have regional votes for purely national / international focused MPs using a proportional representation system.

While proportional representation can be a terrible idea, allowing extreme opinions to influence national decisions, this can be overcome by having a cutoff point.

At the moment there are 650 MPs representing 650 constituencies. Instead reduce this to somewhere between 14 and 20 constituencies. Each constituency would vote with a PR system to elect between 20 and 40 MPs (depending on how large Parliament should be). Any party with less than 2 or 3 MPs would not receive any seats for that constituency.

The number of MPs are totalled up and the parties can then choose which MPs they wish to send. These MPs do not have to relate to the regions which voted. Essentially this allows the parties to stick their preferred candidates at the top of their list and work downwards in priority.

What this system results in is each region voting for their opinion fairly but at the same time not allowing minority single-policy parties access to national government. The population's opinion is represented proportionally within Parliament and the elected MPs can focus entirely on their role for the nation.


### Improved voter involvement

This system would enable people to vote for an effective leader without worrying they may indirectly be voting a party they dislike into national power. It would allow voters to maintain their party allegiances while giving them freedom to choose the right man or woman for their local area.

I suggest this would likely improve voter engagment and increase election turnout.

<!-- #### Applied to 2010 election results

Applying this to the 2010 election results gives the outcome below, though it is worth noting that the actual votes cast would highly likely be different under this system.

## Further discussion points

### The Monarchy

Honestly I just don't think it matters politically if we have a monarchy or not. At this point it has no real powers, there are a few remaining that can be removed at some point in the future. It's just a great source of money, tourism is big bucks, and the cost to taxpayers is more than repaid back into the economy through tourism. I don't imagine it will last past a few more generations anyway.

### An ideal world

In an ideal world democracy would not have to involve sending other people to represent your opinions. You would be able to speak for yourself.

I'll follow this up in a future blog but think; what if your vote was real-time, not once every 5 years? What if you could contribute towards and discuss laws yourself? What if you could vote on every law? What if you could transfer your vote to any individual to vote on your behalf, not just a given party? There are some interesting paths that could be taken when democracy is powered by technology, but there are most certainly some to be aware of as well, notably with regards to security.

### Is any kind of democractic reform likely to happen?

I have no idea. But if it is not discussed then it is guaranteed to not happen.

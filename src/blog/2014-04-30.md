For this week's CodeClub lesson we looked at the python library [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html). It's a easy and fun little graphics library based around moving a "turtle" cursor around the screen, drawing lines and filling in shapes.

For something that is so basic in functionality it's surprising how the results can be so satisfying.

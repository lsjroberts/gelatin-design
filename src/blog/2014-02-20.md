[Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) is an incredibly important concept that has allowed package management to thrive. Combined with [composer](http://getcomposer.org) it has helped transform PHP from a unregulated crazy world to one of order and compatibility.

Yet there is one major problem that I have experienced and seen in several projects. It needs a fourth number at the start, a "philosophical" or "brand" version number.

<!-- more -->

A good example of this is the [Laravel 4.0 to 4.1 update](http://laravel.com/docs/upgrade#upgrade-4.1). 4.1 is a backwards incompatible change, if you just update your `composer.json` to point to the new version your app will break on update. Yet Taylor Otwell rightly doesn't want to change to Laravel 5 as the brand is Laravel 4. You could say Laravel 4 is philoshophically different from Laravel 3, the involved packages have a set approach to them that differs from the previous version.

So really, it shouldn't be numbered as `4.1.0` but `4.1.0.0` and incrementing:

1. BRAND version when you made philosophical changes,
2. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
3. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
4. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
